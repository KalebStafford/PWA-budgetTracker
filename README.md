### Description
This is a budget tracker progressive web app. I got to learn how service workers and manifests.jsons work. You should be able to view this application offline.

fork, clone, or download this repo as a zip. Make your way to the terminal and inside the Develop directory of the project, npm install. Once the node_modules are installed, open the index.html in a browser.
